## Things To Do

  1. Add ORM and a basic user's data and users' activity history.
  2. Add authorisation in the tools only by [Stack Exchange OpneID](https://openid.stackexchange.com/).
  3. Add ability [to post a comment](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/create-comment) from the tools site to the Stack Overflow in a language [through API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/write).
  4. Add a way to make it possible to add restrictions on what users can do (for example if a user adds random association we need to block them).
  5. Add a way to upload csv-data from logs that represents most viewed questions on SOen by Ru-users. Store the uploaded data in a database. If a question exists in the database already, update the counter.
  6. Add a way to mark a question as associated (if one is associated through the app). It should not appear as a question for association if it is marked as an associated one.
  7. Add a way for the associations to be approved/rejected for the community. It's better to add API to the server app and then, add a special review queue through the extension app.

## How To Install

We started deeloping a samll server application (in code aappp, wich means "Association APPlication") based of the [Flask framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Although, most of the code is run on client side, we still need a server app: 1) to serve templates; 2) manage dynamic changes of the state of the association process.

1. Check out code from GitHub to any folder.
2. Create a symbolic link `ln -s /path/to/your/folder/server_app/ /home/aapp`. It means that we assume that the root directory of the project is "/home/aapp". If you want to user another directory, take a look at the *server_app/server.wsgi*, and *server_app/aapp.conf*.
3. [Install Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/). (In my case it was `pip install Flask`.)
4. Install the Apache web server.
5. [Install mod_wsgi for the apache](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/mod_wsgi/).
6. Use the aapp.conf to setup the Apache. Please, take a look at the beggining of the aapp.conf. `ServerName aapp.ru` says that we use *aapp.ru* as the host name. You can use any other. Do not forget to set up your */etc/hosts* to get it redirected to the localhost if you want to run it on your local machine.
