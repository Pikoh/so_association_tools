This is a basic plugin that changes the way how associations look like on international Stack Overflows.

There were some [discussions](http://meta.ru.stackoverflow.com/questions/4500/) on Meta Stack Overflow in Russian, that we have to find a better way of adding associations than through an answer on meta. [It was suggested](http://meta.ru.stackoverflow.com/a/4507/6) to add associations in a comment to a question on an international sites.

Currently we use the following format

__For Stack Overflow in Russian__

    ассоциация: ссылка_на_вопрос_на_английском
    
For exmale, `ассоциация:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3211771/how-to-convert-int-to-qstring`

After adding the extension comments with associations will look like this
